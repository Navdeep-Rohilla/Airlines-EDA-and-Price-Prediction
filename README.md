# ✈️ Airlines Flights Data Analysis & Price Prediction

This project focuses on analyzing airline flight data and building a machine learning pipeline to understand and predict flight prices based on various features such as airline, total stops, duration, departure time, and more.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Airfare pricing is dynamic and depends on multiple factors. Predicting flight prices can help both travelers and travel platforms make informed decisions. This project aims to explore these factors through EDA and build a regression-based foundation for flight price prediction.

---

## 📊 Project Objectives

- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the airline dataset.
- Identify key factors influencing flight ticket prices.
- Preprocess and clean data for modeling.
- Train and evaluate multiple regression models.
- Lay the groundwork for a future real-time price prediction system.
